# Force

Force is simple esoteric language inspired by [Turing machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine), implemented in rust, just for fun (and procrastioantion). I have no idea if I did understand TMs correctly but nevermind.

Name comes from the fact that turing machine is automata with biggest force.

This project pays tribute to [Alan Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing) and Theoretical informatics. (And clients have theoretical money). The only problem is that I'm self-taugth, so its possible that the thing I wrote isn't actually turing complete. But it was fun.
