# Force

Force is simple esoteric language inspired by [Turing machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine), implemented in rust, just for fun (and procrastioantion). I have no idea if I did understand TMs correctly but nevermind.

Name comes from the fact that turing machine is automata with biggest force.

This project pays tribute to [Alan Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing) and Theoretical informatics. (And clients have theoretical money). The only problem is that I'm self-taugth, so its possible that the thing I wrote isn't actually turing complete. But it was fun.

OK, I've discovered that the language for force is actualy regular, so I could have just used simple regex lol. Its funny that language for programming turing machine, which can process level-0 grammars is actualy level-3 lol.


## Alternative readme

Welcome, comrades in code! I present to you "Force", an exotically esoteric language, cooked up in the fiery depths of the "blazingly fast" Rust kitchen, just for the giggles (and to beautifully dodge adulting, of course). The mechanics of Turing machines? Ah, who knows if I've grasped that... but hey, YOLO!

The name "Force"? Well, it's a hat tip to the mighty automata power of Turing machines, almost like the Hulk of the algorithm world, but without the anger management issues.

This project, folks, is a love letter to Alan Turing and the mystical world of theoretical informatics. (And also to those clients who pay in theoretical Bitcoin. insert sarcasm here)

Now, you gotta remember, I'm as self-taught as a cat learning to play the piano. So, there's a teeny-tiny chance that what I've spun up here might not be completely Turing complete. But hey, it's like going on a rollercoaster ride blindfolded â€“ equal parts terrifying and fun!

Plot twist: I just found out that the language for Force is actually regular. Could've just whipped up a simple regex and called it a day! Oh, the irony! The language for programming the granddaddy of all automata, capable of processing level-0 grammars, is chilling at level-3. Cue the laugh track! LOL.
